/*
Given an array arr[] of n integers and an integer target, the task is to find a pair in arr[] such that itâ€™s sum is closest to target.

Note: Return the pair in sorted order and if there are multiple such pairs return the pair with maximum absolute difference. If no such pair exists return an empty array.

Examples:

    Input: arr[] = [10, 30, 20, 5], target = 25
    Output: [5, 20]
    Explanation: Out of all the pairs, [5, 20] has sum = 25 which is closest to 25.

    Input: arr[] = [5, 2, 7, 1, 4], target = 10
    Output: [2, 7]
    Explanation: As (4, 7) and (2, 7) both are closest to 10, but absolute difference of (2, 7) is 5 and (4, 7) is 3. Hence,[2, 7] has maximum absolute difference and closest to target.

    Input: arr[] = [10], target = 10
    Output: []
    Explanation: As the input array has only 1 element, return an empty array.
